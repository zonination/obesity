# Obesity rates in the United States

## About

After taking a look at [this page](http://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/), I wondered what a heatmap would look like if it were made in a way similar to [this project](https://github.com/zonination/election-history).

A heatmap would be a somewhat better display of the original data, allowing people to visualize the rates without the clutter of a line plot, and without the task of having to click the timeline multiple times to visualize trends spatially.
